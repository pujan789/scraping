# scraping

Main.py is the main file and you need chrome driver in your working directory for selenium to work and the description field was loaded on an iframe tag
and Browsers load the iframe content in a separate request and because BeautifulSoup is not a browser; it won't fetch images, CSS and JavaScript resources. 

So I need to use selenium to just get the description from a product.


Feel free to ask me anything anytime, even if there is a minor error,
Thanks,
